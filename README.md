  For this project, I designed the classic game of hangman in which you get eight tries to guess a random word. 
  
    The first method is building functions using for, while and if loops to play Hangman.
    The second method uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by utilising a Hangman Class to code the game.

Similar coding structure but illustrates an understanding of the underlying principles of Python programming including:

    Using the Python Environment
    Variables Assignment
    Dictionary, Tuples, Lists
    Control Flow and Loops
    Designing Functions
    Object- Oriented Programming
    Problem Solving (Nothing gets solved on the first try :] )

Any suggestion to improve the code is always welcome!
